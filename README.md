2. Learning OOP Concepts

> A **struct** can **only define a different variables**, but a **class** can **define different variables and declare functions too**

> If you have **two or more classes**, and you **want to have the functions inside those classes in a new class**, you can use the **inheritance** property. By using the inheritance property, you can reuse the function inside the existing classes in a new class. The new class that is going to inherit an existing class is called a **derived** class. The existing class is called a **base** class.
